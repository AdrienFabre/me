During\n                his time with BetterSpace, Adrien quickly picked up new skills\n                with React and AWS and put them to good use in various projects,\n                mostly involving internal tools.\n                <br /> These projects involved image compression, API automated\n                testing, translating data between Airtable and Dynamo and\n                building a brand new tool for the purpose of reconciling\n                transactional data between our own database and Xero - not an\n                easy feat! Especially during the latter project, in addition to\n                the technical improvements, Adrien gained experience in\n                wireframing, UI and UX design, collating complex requirements\n                from various stakeholders and managing and taking ownership of\n                the project.\n                <br />\n                Adrien is very enthusiastic to learn new things and improve his\n                existing knowledge. He is extremely passionate about \"tech for\n                good\" and always brings new ideas to the table. Adrien's time at\n                BetterSpace has been invaluable for improving the team's\n                workflow and I wish him all the best for his future!\"\n              </p>\n              <p></p>\n            </ul>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n        <div className=\"card\">\n          <div\n            className={`title ${selectedSection === \"WEX05\" && \"highlight\"}`}\n            onClick={() => this.props.updateSelectedSection(\"WEX05\")}\n          >\n            2019 -

Ever since Adrien first\n              attended one of our events he was extremely enthusiastic and\n              connected with our values.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              Very soon after attending his first event he was eager to jump on\n              board and learn how to facilitate one of our workshops. By\n              conducting these workshops he got to deeply understand several\n              social entrepreneurs and help them figure out how to improve their\n              business. He did these extremely well and soon became part of the\n              core team. 6 months after he attended his first MakeSense workshop\n              Adrien was the lead in organising a large-scale event “Food\n              Glorious Food” tackling food waste with a full day event with\n              workshops, activities, and talks featuring 12 different social\n              entrepreneurs in the food sustainability sector. Adrien found the\n              venue, negotiated using it for free, came up with the concept,\n              created the marketing materials and was directing 6 other\n              volunteers to pull off a really successful event.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              Adrien demonstrates a really strong work ethic. If he says he will\n              do something he will go to great lengths to make sure it gets\n              done. I have also found that he learns very quickly. If he is\n              interested in something he will dive head first into it,\n              contacting people to talk to and create opportunities to learn as\n              much as he can by doing. He is a self-starter and very good at\n              finding ways to improve the ways we work together. I have been\n              very privileged to work with him over the last 18 months and know\n              that wherever he goes next he will be focused, determined and a\n              powerful asset to the business.”\n            </p>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n        <div className=\"card\">\n          <div\n            className={`title ${selectedSection === \"REC01\" && \"highlight\"}`}\n            onClick={() => this.props.updateSelectedSection(\"REC01\")}\n          >\n            Mursal Hedayat, CEO at Chatterbox, FounderForbes 30 Under 30 Social\n            Entrepreneur\n          </div>\n          <div className={`text ${selectedSection === \"REC01\" && \"show\"}`}>\n            <p>\n              <a\n                href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/mursalhedayat/\"\n                target=\"_blank\"\n                rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\n              >\n                Mursal Hedayat\n              </a>\n              : “It was a delightful working with Adrien.
